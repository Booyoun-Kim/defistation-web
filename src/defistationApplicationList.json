These interest rates are set by the protocol in a curve yield, where the rates are automated based on the demand of the specific market, such as Bitcoin. The difference of Venus from other money market protocols is the ability to use the collateral supplied to the market\nnot only to borrow other assets but also to mint synthetic stablecoins with over-collateralized positions that protect the protocol.

With HCS extraordinary, modern blockchain technology, the sector of donations will revel in a significant transformation regarding security and speed of delivery.\nTaking part in the HCS ICO will provide you with the opportunity to be a part of this innovative blockchain-based decentralized undertaking in addition to receiving the benefit of earnings from the preliminary supplying.\nProblems Facing the Industry\nToday, if someone wants to send a payment, as an example, one US Dollar to an organization; the journey taken by that dollar before it reaches its destination is both extremely time consuming and costly. This problem becomes compounded even further when dealing with different currencies Every pit stop and loophole that dollar has to make on the way to its final destination decreases its value. It’s eaten away in legal, transaction, processing and other fees until finally, when this dollar does arrive at its destination, only a fraction of it goes to the organization that it was originally intended for. With Help Coins, this entire process can occur anywhere on the planet in seconds, at virtually no cost. \nAnother large problem facing the current market, is the inability to hold organizations receiving funds accountable to the use of those funds. But now, in the age of blockchain and the distributed ledger, there is a perfect solution. Smart contracts can be used to streamline payments, even place certain conditions and contingencies on payments, to ensure resources and funding are allocated where they are needed the most. With Binance Smart Chain, and our HCS Token, individuals will be able to make contributions based on certainty as opposed to faith. Help Coins isn't designed to simply decrease corruption and responsible spending, but eliminate it entirely through the utilization of smart contracts and the distributed ledger, this distributed ledger will also make financial reporting far simpler than the current system in place, with the end goal being to eliminate year-end filing in its entirety. Transactions can be automatically tracked, monitored and sent off to revenue services for filing purposes. This process is fascinating in that it is both transparent and private at the same time.\nThe Path to Protocol \nOur ability to facilitate change in the fundraising market will largely depend on the amount of capital raised during our token sale. At minimum, HCS will be building an application on top of the Binance Smart chain Blockchain by issuing its own BEP20 Token. This alone is intended to create value for our early investors and solve many problems facing the fundraising market today. However, HCS designed not only to take charity, to the next level but also help individuals who took part in our ICO increase and multiply their investment.\nMission, Vision and Help projects \nHelp Cains’s mission and vision is to create a new global standard for the fundraising industry by creating the first global and decentralized donation marketplace. A market that provides organizations with a new and better method to raise funds by utilizing innovations in blockchain technology. A method that is cheaper, faster and more transparent than the current model all while rewarding people and organizations for participating in the process.\nHelp Coins Projects \n•\tHCS team will supervise All projects and post every Success on twitter \n•\tAll Help coins projects not from tokens the users have it will be from15% of token Allocation.\nMaking Water wells in poor villages in Africa\nCrypto Against COVID \nSend a donation to poor hospitals around the world\nSend a donation to the Homeless Organizations\nFinancial support for poor students and schools\nRecovery from DRUG ABUSE: Donate to organizations only\nDonate to animal charity Organization to protect poor animals\nMake charities accept our tokens and we will list the names of these charities in our website.\nSend 100,000 HCS every month to Binance Charity for 10 months.\nCompetitive Advantages \nDecentralizing the already massive donation market comes with many advantages over the current centralized model:\n Lower Fees and Faster Transactions \nIn today’s environment, organizations receiving funds are forced to rely on traditional FIAT Banking Institutions which have a monopoly on the the assets and transfer process. When an individual or organization initiates a transaction, they are essentially requesting their bank to perform the transaction on their behalf. This centralized implementation in today's FIAT banking system causes loss of power and control from the end user, who is the true owner of the asset. These institutions can in turn perform actions not directly in the best interest of the end user. This process is time consuming and expensive, yet it occurs continually throughout the day. With HCS this process can be decentralized. Transactions can occur quickly anywhere on the planet with virtually no cost.\nYear-end Filing and Financial Reporting: Transparent yet Private \nDue to the decentralized nature of a blockchain, the distributed ledger allows for the public visibility of every transaction recorded. As the ledger is distributed across the network and its members, any transaction, once recorded within the ledger, is permanently recorded and is immutable and irrefutable within the network. However, also due to the decentralized nature of blockchain, this is private and secure. No single entity controls this already encrypted data. This distribution of data intrinsically ensures that the data remains secure. In addition, as the blockchain utilizes a hash address, the information can be identified by the initiator of the transaction, also known as the address holder, but not by the public.\nThis technology will allow for a more efficient year end filings system for tax purposes and all financial reporting in general. A distributed ledger is a disruptive technology in the financial space. It has the potential to completely overhaul the current regulatory and reporting landscape. While it may be going too far and be too soon to suggest these technologies will be able to eliminate specific filing requirements, they will certainly be able to reduce the back and forth between the \norganizations reporting financial information, and the organizations receiving and processing financial information\nLeveling the Playing Field \nIn today's centralized market, it is impossible to instantly send money from one country to another when dealing with different currencies. In order to facilitate this process, organizations rely on large central banks; banks that take large fees and multiple days to process a single payment. This process is especially hard, sometimes impossible for smaller organizations, or organizations that are located in smaller developing countries/principalities. \nHCS would level the playing field on a global scale, so payment processing is cheap, fast and easy regardless of borders or the jurisdiction of any government. This was one of the primary reasons cryptocurrencies were created in the first place. \n","Security Information":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5316075.0\nhttps://github.com/help-coins\n" },

This is a more sustainable, realistic model that can provide high, long-term yields. This is possible because just like a real business, Cobalt generates a revenue. This revenue is solely derived from transfer fees. Whenever a user transfers CBT, 5% of the transaction value is distributed to stakers, the other 5% is burned permanently, furthermore increasing the value of each CBT token. The more tokens you stake, the more fees you will earn, this is the reason why there is no fixed APY. The burning mechanism goes on until only 5 million tokens are left, this will be the final supply. After the final supply is reached, users will continue getting yields, as the 5% transfer fee is still present.","Security Information":"As our project solidity code is rather simple, we found it was sufficient enough to do an internal audit among the projects' developers.

Linear’s long term DeFi vision is to increase inclusiveness and democratize access to investment assets (digital and traditional). Tremendous value exists in the ability for investors to easily and quickly invest, save fees, and secure assets at fair market value. Linear combines substantial technical experience from numerous crypto projects with extensive financial experience in exotic and structured assets from traditional global asset management firms to bring to market one of the first DeFi projects built upon Ethereum with cross-chain compatibility. Linear will allow users to build and manage spot or portfolio exposures with a slew of innovative digital and traditional financial products. Linear is backed by our Ethereum-based Linear Token (LINA) with synthetic assets built on other EVM compatible chains first and other prominent blockchains in the long run, making the staking, investing, and redemption process easier, quicker and with substantially lower transaction fees whilst maintaining access to the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem.\n\nLinear is a non-custodial cross-chain compatible DeFi protocol with unlimited liquidity and serves in the creation of synthetic assets (Liquids) with zero slippage. The backbone to Linear’s protocol is our collateralized debt pool, backed by our Linear token (LINA), and eventually other digital and real world assets. Users who have provided collateralized assets to the debt pool are able to “build” Linear USD (lUSD) which can then be used to purchase synthetic assets (Liquids) on our exchange. The collateralized assets are subsequently pooled to enable instantaneous liquidity and serve as a counterparty. LINA will also be a governance token enabling holders to vote on distribution models, assets to be listed, oracle selection, pledge ratio etc. LINA holders within the debt pool will obtain pro-rata fees from the building of Liquids.\n\nThe LINA token will adopt an inflationary model to enhance staking incentives and will have liquidity mining programs to encourage usage of the exchange and stability of the pool. Synthetization of assets will focus on cryptocurrencies, commodities and, more importantly, traditional assets such as market indices and thematic theme exposures.\n\nThe long term vision of Linear is to provide a platform for any user to gain exposure to a wide range of assets without slippage and settlement time. Furthermore, Linear Finance will act as a reliable gateway with the adoption of cryptocurrency we saw in 2020 and the collaboration of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Centralized Finance (CeFi). Applications can be developed on top of Linear for CeFi / DeFi composability.","Security Information":"All of our smart contracts have been submitted to Slowmist for code auditing.

Bitcoin Standard Hashrate Token (“BTCST”) solves this problem by bringing exchange-grade liquidity to Bitcoin mining. Each BTCST is collateralized by a fixed amount of Bitcoin mining power. By staking BTCSTs, holders of the tokens will receive daily Bitcoin distributions that correspond to the mining power staked. And because the market price of BTCST is determinable as the discounted cashflow of the underlying mining power, BTCST in secondary trading will perform as a leveraged Bitcoin token free from liquidation risk. BTCST will create an efficient market for Bitcoin’s mining power in ways similar to how Grayscale Bitcoin Trust creates institutional liquidity for Bitcoin. To reduce user experience frictions in DeFi, BTCST is issued and operates on top of Binance Smart Chain.","Detailed Project Description":"Unlike nearly all other virtual assets, BTCST is a collateral-backed asset. Standard Hashrate Group, the community organizers, pioneered issuing hashrate-backed assets - in this case Bitcoin - directly onto a DeFi platform. And as a result, BTCST provides the market with premium collateral to further expand the DeFi ecosystem. Since its launch in early January, the community-led project has also enabled its holders to participate in the governance process such as voting on upgrades to the dapp itself. The BTCST dapp was deployed onto Binance Smart Chain because it provides a low-cost user experience without sacrificing transparency that miners demand. The dapp uses Binance BTC (BTCB) to regularly distribute profits so that even small amounts of BTC can be easily withdrawn which is not possible with the native Bitcoin chain. Standard Hashrate Group is intended to be an open association, where we, together, provide a service to all eligible miners to tokenize their hash rate. Our goal is to be the Grayscale Trust for Bitcoin mining hash rate. In a few years, we aim to be working with all the major miners and mining facilities around the world, so we can bring meaningful liquidity to anyone - including DeFi holders - who want exposure to this rapidly growing industry.

This vastly simplifies yield aggregating, reduces gas fees, and enables individuals of all ranges of DeFi experience and available capital to benefit from the process.\n\nTinfoil Finance can be used for a multitude of yield farming purposes, including those seeking maximal yields and those seeking to balance risks and rewards. Thus, we aim to promote additional value and support to the underlying DeFi ecosystem.","Detailed Project Description":"The major advantage of the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) over other chains is the lower gas fee. By lowering the cost of participating in this process, BSC therefore opens up opportunities for individuals with less capital to invest to enter the DeFi space and still generate profits. Tinfoil Finance utilizes this technology to enable users to benefit from yield compounding in an incredibly simple and streamlined manner, making the process accessible to any user, regardless of DeFi experience or available capital. This is facilitated through Tinfoil Finance’s calculations of the optimal compounding frequency for each user, and the subsequent automatic compounding of user tokens via its smart contract infrastructure.\n\nBSC-based yield aggregators like Tinfoil Finance typically utilize PancakeSwap to carry out their function. PancakeSwap (https://pancakeswap.finance/) is the top automated market maker (AMM) and yield farm on the BSC. The farms on our protocol will exist on Pancake Swap, getting the permission of individual users via smart contracts to automatically compound and reinvest their yields.\n\nThe initial yield optimization strategies we will incorporate are that of our own token TIN, the TIN LP, CAKE (native to PancakeSwap), BAKE, AUTO, XVS, BUNNY, BIFI, wSOTE, and BURGER pools. We will adapt these and additional pools as needed, continually seeking to generate the most optimal and usefield yield generating strategies. Tinfoil Finance also facilitates yield optimization via farms (discussed in more detail later in this document). Our farms enable users to profit from certain pools on our protocol, and then have those profits automatically compounded in the CAKE compounding pool, resulting in a vastly larger return while still protecting the principal.\n\nFinally, Tinfoil Finance is developing a cross-chain interoperable version, bridging ETH-BSC, enabling more ETH users to participate in our BSC-based yield farming and receive the benefits of our protocol","Security Information":"https://twitter.com/TinfoilFinance/status/1362814967767060485" },

LaserSwap has a mechanism that penalizes speculators who disobey the rules and incentivizes investors who hold firm beliefs in this project.","Detailed Project Description":"Introduction\nLaserSwap is a BEP-20 governance token that adopts a community-oriented strategy to achieve and enhance community consensus. In the current autonomous strategy-executing platforms, the incentives for liquidity mining are flawed and short-minded in that most people want to get yield on their money and do not care about the underlying project. Hence, devs of LaserSwap designed an explicit reward vs. punishment mechanism to ward off speculative behaviors since opportunists are the most significant factor for volatility. LaserSwap will penalize speculators who disobey the rules and incentivize investors who hold firm beliefs in this project. The purpose of this mechanism is to maintain a constant growth of liquidity while creating more value for LaserSwap and its token, leaving hefty returns for the investors.\nLaserSwap team believes that maintaining a solid yield over a few years rather than a few days is a necessary step to grow the DeFi space further.\nLiquidity Mining\n      LaserSwap involves two major methods of transaction: Liquidity mining and trading tokens.\nl  Trading tokens\nBuying and selling LAS on exchanges such as PancakeSwap is allowed.\nl  Liquidity Mining\nLiquidity Mining, also called Yield Farming, is the main way of obtaining LAS token. It is also the most effective way to generate returns. LaserSwap team will kickstart the initial distribution with a liquidity generation event, providing 200,000 LAS to the initial liquidity. However, note that once liquidity is added, liquidity tokens can not be removed from the LaserSwap pools. This is by design to encourage long-term investments. To encourage real value and TVL to flow into LaserSwap, LaserSwap smart contracts employ interchangeable strategies that farm the coins inside the pools. This gives a great incentive to anyone who wants to farm LAS with coins other than LAS/BUSD LP. However, unstaking is allowed with a certain fee as punishment. The reward vs. punishment mechanism will effectively prevent speculators from reaping the benefits from believers, i.e. the long-term investors. \nKeeping Liquidity Liquid\nAll transfers have to be approved by the LaserSwap Transfers smart contract, which will block all liquidity withdrawals from PancakeSwap. This will guarantee a stable market, giving holders and farmers skin in the game.\nTeam Income\nTeam operations require financial support from constant cash flow. To ensure DeFi activities on LaserSwap proceed on the right track, 1% of profits generated from the above strategies will be used as team income. Note that there will be no impact on either LaserSwap liquidity or harvested amount of LAS.\nTokenomics\nThe total supply of LAS token is 1,000,000. There is no way to mint more tokens. 200,000 LAS will be added to the initial liquidity while the remaining 800,000 can be obtained via liquidity mining. There will be 30,000 LAS tokens generated daily and the rate of minting will be halved every 10 days until 800,000 tokens are produced. The value of LAS tokens will be determined completely on community consensus as LaserSwap relies on no presale, no premining, and no foundation.\nSecurity\nOnce liquidity is added, they cannot be removed from the LaserSwap LP pools because we will add a 90-day liquidity lock and a 24-hour timelock on LaserSwap. Our team is willing to get the whole community involved in contract auditing, therefore we decide to make LaserSwap an open-source project. LaserSwap’s contract code can be found on Github.\nCommunity Governance\nTeam LaserSwap advocates community governance, meaning that the community members decide everything, such as adding new pools and new features or disabling pools. We will launch DAO voting strategy on Snapshot shortly after the project launch and begin proposal voting. This way we can get the whole community involved in putting forward proposals favoring the community.\nFuture Plans\nTeam LaserSwap plans for stage V1 and V2 for LaserSwap in 2021. Currently, in stage V1, only liquidity mining is available for users to obtain LAS tokens. The TVL and community base will lay out a solid foundation for future development. Stage V2 will begin after all 800,000 tokens are minted. Stage V2 will incorporate features such as LaserVault and lending options, which will be elaborated in the Roadmap section.

In other words, Suterusu protocol not only provides anonymity for the involved parties and but also transactional confidentiality.\n\nSuter Shield allows the sender of a transaction to arbitrarily select the target receiver of a confidential transaction without the need of sharing any secret with the receiver beforehand. Therefore, it is not only much more user-friendly, but it also provides a foundation to adapt to more sophisticated privacy-preserving DeFi functionalities such as DEX, insurance, loan, etc.\n\nIn addition, compared with other similar solution, Suter Shield not only facilitates the anonymous and confidential transactions of BNB and BEP-20 tokens, but it is also a much more modularized and universal privacy-protection solution for any smart-contract platforms, which is why we can easily transform our solutions to other platforms such as BSC or HECO. Furthermore, the Suter VM not only provides anonymous payment functionality for smart contract platforms but also anonymous BTC cross-chain functionality that will bring more liquidity to the Suter ecosystem.\n\nSuterusu’s vision to provide privacy-protection for the users of all digital assets, therefore, Suterusu takes regulation compliance to its heart at the beginning of the system design. We apply blacklist and recursive blacklisting to ensure our system is regulation compliant. Any Suter transfer operation is required to compare the sender accounts of a transaction to the blacklist accounts. A transaction that involves any blacklist account will be rejected. This will guarantee the Suterusu ecosystem will effectively eradicate any misbehavior that is against the financial regulation, such as money laundry.","Security Information":"PeckShield Audited: https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Suterusu-v1.0.pdf" },

Featuring a native governance token called NIU that is fully community distributed, decisions will be taken by NIU holders in a DAO Gov platform, we are partnering with the famous Snapshot using weekly polls to generate a fully functional project governed by the user of Niubiswap #NIU. \n","Security Information":"We are in process of getting our Certik audit approved.

We have decided to leverage this fact for the benefit of our platform, so 90% of DGNZ lost in a gamble are automatically burned while 9% are added back into the gamble pot and 1% are taken as a house fee.\nThis automated burning mechanism does not depend on the developers to manually send tokens to a dead wallet, although the developers will occasionally engage in buybacks and manual burning in order to further boost deflation and helps stabilize the price.\n\n✅ ANTIRUG measure: Initial liquidity is locked ,the LP are sent to a timelocked vault set with a 7 days delay (we also regularly burn tokens )\n\n✅Here are some further developments the devs are currently working on : adding new pools, compounding, integration of wallets, website redesign, smartphone compatibility, new games + animations, NFTs, governance ...\n\n","Security Information":"Audit in process by techrate" },

Swamp.finance is a yield optimizer hosted on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Swampy token’s utility is for participation in voting on SwampDAO proposals. As an incentive to deposit their assets in Swamp.finance vaults users are getting a bonus yield in Swampy. \nHow to obtain SWAMP?\nSWAMP token is traded on Pancakeswap, one of the leading decentralized exchanges (DEX) hosted on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Pancakeswap is an automated market maker (AMM) that allows users to buy SWAMP tokens and instantly exchange them with other BEP-20 type tokens listed on Pancakeswap.\nWhat is Swamp.finance?\nSwamp.finance is a yield optimizer, which enables yield aggregation for holders and users of SWAMP token. To facilitate automation of the yield farming and the process of compounding, Swamp.finance uses vaults. Vaults also enable a more efficient utilization of gas, as well as other automated processes, and use different yield strategies to help users grow their assets through automation. Swamp.finance has an optimal compounding strategy with an efficient pricing model, designed to encourage long-term yield farming and provide appropriate incentives for long-term holders. Thanks to the automation factor in the process of yield generation and compounding, users don't need to manually reinvest their staking rewards, but can rely on automated asset growth by simply making a deposit into a Swamp.finance vault. SWAMP holders also don’t need to have extensive knowledge of the underlying protocols that support automation and yield optimization, while depositing funds to vaults represents a passive investment strategy. The goal is to increase the initial value of assets deposited by users, similar to how crypto hedge funds work, with minimal involvement on users’ end.","Security Information":"Audits are soon to be provided.
